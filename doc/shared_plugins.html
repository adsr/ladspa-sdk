<H1>Shared Plugins</H1>

<P>Plugins may be used by a range of different hosts. However, the
host needs to be able to find the plugins. Hosts vary, however the
recommended method uses the environment variable
<CODE>LADSPA_PATH</CODE>. If present, this should contain a
colon-separated path indicating directories that should be searched
(in order) when loading plugin types.</P>

<P>It is recommended for standard Linux distributions such as RedHat,
that this plugin path should be
<CODE>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.ladspa:/usr/local/lib/ladspa:/usr/lib/ladspa</CODE>.
Plugins can then be installed into <CODE>/usr/local/lib/ladspa/</CODE>
or <CODE>/usr/lib/ladspa/</CODE>.</P>

<P>You may wish to add a line such as the following to your
.bash_profile login file (if you use Bash): <CODE>export
LADSPA_PATH=$LADSPA_PATH:/home/&lt;user&gt;/.ladspa:/usr/local/lib/ladspa:/usr/lib/ladspa</CODE></P>

<P>To list the plugins that can be found on your
<CODE>LADSPA_PATH</CODE>, run the <CODE>listplugins</CODE>
program.</P>
