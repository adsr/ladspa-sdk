<H1>Unique IDs</H1>

<P>Plugin types are identified by unique IDs. At the time of writing
plugin writers may request these from <A
HREF="mailto:ladspa@muse.demon.co.uk">ladspa@muse.demon.co.uk.</A>
This may change, in which case <A HREF="http://www.ladspa.org">
http://www.ladspa.org</A> is likely to provide information on new
sources.</P>

<P>Plugin IDs 1-1000 are reserved for development use and plugins must
not be released publicly with these IDs as clashes are likely. Plugin
ID 0 will never be allocated.</P>

<P>It is hoped that plugin IDs will fit into 24bits. In the unlikely
event that this range needs to be extended it will be, possibly with
the addition of a second dimension (e.g. developer ID). In the
meantime hosts may assume that IDs will not exceed 0x00FFFFFF.</P>
