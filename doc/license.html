<H1>LADSPA and LADSPA SDK License</H1>

<P>The LADSPA Software Development Kit and the LADSPA plugin API
itself are licensed under <A HREF="COPYING">LGPL version 2.1</A>.</P>

<P>Please note that this is <EM>not intended to be the final license
for LADSPA</EM>. In the long term it is hoped that LADSPA will have a
public license that is even less restrictive, so that commercial
applications can use it without having to use a derived LGPL library
(in a way that still protects the open-source community). It may be
that LGPL is already free enough for this, but we aren't sure. Does
anyone want to pay for a lawyer? In the meantime, please mail me if
this is an issue for you.</P>
